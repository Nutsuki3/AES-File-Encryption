# AES 128/192/256, ECB/CBC/GCM File Encryption/Decryption

This is a Java program that can be used to encrypt and decrypt files using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. This program supports AES 128, 192, and 256-bit encryption with ECB, CBC, and GCM block modes.

## Prerequisites

Before using this program, you will need to have the following software installed on your system:

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher


## Usage

To use it, you can run the Main.java file for Encrypt/decrypt files simultaneously.

## Function and Encrypt Mode

You can encrypt with the following modes :
- [**Electronic Codebook (ECB)**](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Electronic-Code-Book)
- [**Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)**](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-cbc)
- [**Galios/Counter Mode (GCM)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)

And iterate encryption, Yes! you can iterate your file encryption but to decrypt the file depends on the number of times you encrypt it. If you are worried that your files will be damaged, you can choose to use the Backup function.

## Security

Please note that to encrypt and decrypt data using AES, it is important to use strong encryption keys and choose best practices for handling sensitive data.
